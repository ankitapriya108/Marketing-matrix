          <h1 class="fw-bold text-black mt-4">Cookie Policy</h1>
          <p class="pt-2">
            Our <a href="./privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> explains our
            principles when it comes to the collection, processing, and storage
            of your information. This policy specifically explains how we, our
            partners, and users of our services deploy cookies, as well as the
            options you have to control them.
          </p>
          <h3 class="fw-bold text-black mt-4">What are cookies?</h3>
          <p class="py-2">
            Cookies are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are
            stored on your computer or other device when websites are loaded in
            a browser. They are widely used to “remember” you and your
            preferences, either for a single visit (through a “session cookie”)
            or for multiple repeat visits (using a “persistent cookie”). They
            ensure a consistent and efficient experience for visitors, and
            perform essential functions such as allowing users to register and
            remain logged in. Cookies may be set by the site that you are
            visiting (known as “first party cookies”), or by third parties, such
            as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics
            services on the website (“third party cookies”).
          </p>
          <p>
            Both websites and HTML emails may also contain other tracking
            technologies such as “web beacons” or “pixels.” These are typically
            small transparent images that provide us with statistics, for
            similar purposes as cookies. They are often used in conjunction with
            cookies, though they are not stored on your computer in the same
            way. As a result, if you disable cookies, web beacons may still
            load, but their functionality will be restricted.
          </p>
          <h3 class="text-black fw-bold mt-4">How we use cookies</h3>
          <p class="py-2">
            We use cookies for a number of different purposes. Some cookies are
            necessary for technical reasons; some enable a personalized
            experience for both visitors and registered users; and some allow
            the display of advertising from selected third party networks. Some
            of these cookies may be set when a page is loaded, or when a visitor
            takes a particular action (clicking the “like” or “follow” button on
            a post, for example).
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2">
            Many of the cookies we use are only set if you are a registered
            WordPress.com user (so you don’t have to log in every time, for
            example), while others are set whenever you visit one of our
            websites, irrespective of whether you have an account.
          </p>
          <p>
            For more information on the choices you have about the cookies we
            use, please see the Controlling Cookies section below
          </p>
          <h3 class="text-black fw-bold mt-4">Types of Cookie</h3>
          <p class="py-2">
            The table below explains the types of cookies we use on our websites
            and why we use them.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2">
            Required Cookies: These cookies are essential for our websites and
            services to perform basic functions and are necessary for us to
            operate certain features. These include those required to allow
            registered users to authenticate and perform account-related
            functions, store preferences set by users such as account name,
            language, and location, and ensure our services are operating
            properly.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2">
            <strong>Analytics</strong> and <strong>Performance:</strong> These
            cookies allow us to optimize performance by collecting information
            on how users interact with our websites, including which pages are
            visited most, as well as other analytical data. We use these details
            to improve how our websites function and to understand how users
            interact with them. Performance Cookies do not store any Personal
            Information. Specifically, for analytics providers, we use Google
            Analytics. Google Analytics, which is a web analytics service
            offered by Google, tracks and reports website traffic. This service
            uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service.
            Google Analytics shares this data with other Google services. Google
            may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads
            of its own advertising network. You can opt-out of having made your
            activity on the Service available to Google Analytics by installing
            the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the
            Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from
            sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity. For
            more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit
            the Google Privacy & Terms web page:
            <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/"
              >https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a
            >
            Google also recommends installing the Google Analytics Opt-out
            Browser Add-on –
            <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout"
              >https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a
            >
            – for your web browser. Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on
            provides visitors with the ability to prevent their data from being
            collected and used by Google Analytics
